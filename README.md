# react-website-boilerplate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/linuswillner/react-website-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is my personal React boilerplate with hot reloading, SASS support and Standard code style. This repository is a derivative of the code generated by [simple-react-app](https://github.com/Kornil/simple-react-app).

## What's different?

This project has a class-based React code structure and uses the Standard code style, contrary to a functional code structure and Airbnb style. This is a matter of personal preference, but I like to keep things consistent.

## Installation and usage

To use this, simply clone the repository to a folder and start editing.

Scripts:

**npm start**: Starts the development web server on **localhost:8000**.
**npm test**: Runs ESLint style checks.
**npm run build**: Creates a production build.
